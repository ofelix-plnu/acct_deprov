Welcome to Account Deprovisioning's documentation!
==================================================

This process simplifies the management of employee terminations by automating tasks involved in the decommissioning process. It ensures the removal of access and permissions, facilitates delegation to relevant mangers, and automates these actions on a schedule, allowing HR and IT departments to react to changes and errors. The application is written in Python and built on AWS using the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit).
